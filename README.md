# chatbot-restaurant
Chatbot for a restaurant using [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/lp/confluent-kafka), [AWS BedRock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [GroqCloud](https://console.groq.com) and [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/).

As GroqCloud is free to use the current LLM model used (`mixtral-8x7b-32768`) has the following limitations:
- Requests per minute: 30
- Requests per day: 14,400
- Tokens per minute: 18,000

If you prefer, you can opt to use OpenAI or AWS Bedrock but bear in mind they are paid services. To select the model, set `.env` accordingly (details below).

Qdrant, although has the [SaaS Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/) option this demo uses the local/docker version (https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client) of it.

## Demo Diagram
![image](docs/demo_diagram.png)

## Requirements
- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)

## The Demo
This demo runs all on Docker and it was only tested on a MAC M1. In case needed change the platform option to your needs (see variable `PLATFORM` on the file `.env`). For example, if you have a macOS you need to set the environmental variable `PLATFORM` to `linux/amd64`.

To be able to interact with AWS BedRock, OpenAI or Groq LLM model, you will need the following API key:
* [GroqCloud](https://console.groq.com) free LLM engine
* [AWS BedRock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock) paid LLM engine
* [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup) paid LLM engine

**Important** If using AWS BedRock make sure to:
 - Enable access to the LLM model of your preference (e.g. `Titan Text G1 - Premier` (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html)) for the AWS Region of your choice
 - Set the right permission to AmazonBedRock when creating the Security Credentials for your IAM user

Having the API key at hand, create a file named `.env` file by executing the command:
```bash
cat > .env <<EOF

You are now ready to start the demo!

### Running the demo
You can make use of the shell script `./demo.sh` to have the demo started, stopped and restarted:
```
usage: ./demo.sh [-h, --help] [-x, --start] [-p, --stop] [-r, --restart]

Demo: Chatbot for a Restaurant (Confluent - All rights reserved)

Options:
 -h, --help     Show this help message and exit
 -x, --start    Start demo
 -p, --stop     Stop demo
 -r, --restart  Restart microservices
```

To automatically start the demo, run `./demo.sh -x`, once the docker images are downloaded, it should take less than 2 minutes to have everything up and running.

### Demo in details

#### Context required
Data will be automatically loaded into a Postgres DB by the python script `src/db_provisioning.py` (localhost:5432, see `docker-composer.yml` for details). All tables created and data preloaded are shown on the folder `src\sql`, below a summary:
 - `src/sql/001_customer_profile.sql`: All customer profiles (password will be hash salted, but since this is a demo, the password is the same as the username)
 - `src/sql/002_policies.sql`: Restaurant policies (loaded into the initial LLM prompt)
 - `src/sql/003_restaurant.sql`: Restaurant information (loaded into the initial LLM prompt)
 - `src/sql/004_ai_rules.sql`: Chatbot rules (loaded into the initial LLM prompt)
 - `src/sql/005_extras.sql`: Additional restaurant policies (loaded into the VectorDB and only injected to the prompt when needed)
 - `src/sql/006_main_menu.sql`: Restaurant's main menu (loaded into the initial LLM prompt)
 - `src/sql/007_kids_menu.sql`: Restaurant's kids menu (loaded into the initial LLM prompt)

A [Postgres CDC source connector](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-cdc-source-v2-debezium/cc-postgresql-cdc-source-v2-debezium.html) will make sure to capture any change (insert, update, delete) and have them published to Confluent Platform.

#### Chatbot back-end microservices
REST API (`src/embeddings.py`) to use Hugging Face's sentence transformer to generate the vector data (embeddings: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). It is a basic HTTP service where a sentence is passed as a GET request and the vector data is returned, for example:
```
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data "This is a simple document" http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/embedding/setence-transformer

```

Kafka2vDB microservice (python script `src/kafka2vDB.py`) to run a Qdrant vector search engine, create a local collection (`chatbot_restaurant`), generate the embeddings (using sentence transformer `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and load add Vector DB data (as consumed from the corresponding topic) into it

The chatbot back-end microservice (python script `src/chatbot.py`) will start and perform the following tasks:
 - Thread #1:
   - Load in memory the Customer Profiles, AI Rules, Restaurant Policies, Restaurant Information, Main Menu and Kids Menu (as consumed from the corresponding topics)
 - Thread #2:
   - Consume the customer messages from topic `chatbot-customer_actions` and post it to the LLM engine (as set on the environment variable `LLM_ENGINE`). It uses LangChain to be able to seemlesly interact with AWS BedRock, OpenAI or GroqCloud. All messages are buffered in memory per user session and cleared after logout. This can be optmised in order to reduce the number of tokens passed everything to the LLM engine
   - The initial LLM prompt will contain the name of the waiter/AI assistant, name/age of the customer as well as all AI Rules, Restaurant Policies, Restaurant Information, Main Menu and Kids Menu, for example:

We have a new customer. Their name is James Young, is 11 years old and is allergic to nothing
Hi!
```
   - For every customer message it will also run a semantic search on the vector DB and if found any relevant document (limited by the environment variable `VECTOR_DB_SEARCH_LIMIT` as long as the score is > `VECTOR_DB_MIN_SCORE`) and inject into the LLM prompt as a system message. That is to limit the amount of tokens passed to the LLM engine, for example:
     * Customer query: `do you have a pool table? what is the wifi password?`
     * The two documents returned by the vector DB are:
       - `dart-and-pool-table: Dart boards and pool tables available for guests. Challenge your friends or join a game. All are welcome!`
       - `wifi: Complimentary high-speed and free WiFi for all our guests`
     * The LLM engine can then provide a contextual relevant response as it now knows the dart/pool and wifi details:
```
Hello again,
Yes, we do have dart boards and pool tables available for our guests. Feel free to challenge your friends or join a game. We hope you'll enjoy this additional entertainment during your visit.
Regarding the WiFi, our high-speed internet is complimentary and free for all our guests. The WiFi network name is "StreamBite\_Guest" and the password is "StreamBiteFun123". We hope you enjoy staying connected during your time with us.
If you have any other questions, please let me know.
Best regards,
Steven Mayo
```
   - Once it receives the response from the LLM engine it will have it published into the topic `chatbot-chatbot_responses`

#### Web Application
The last python script is the web application (`src/webapp.py`):
 - It communicates with the back-end chatbot microservices using the [CQRS pattern](https://www.confluent.io/resources/ebook/designing-event-driven-systems)
 - After successfuly login, the customer messages will be published to the topic `chatbot-customer_actions` so it can be processed by the back-end microservices
 - It will also consume the messages from the topic `chatbot-chatbot_responses` matching the sessionID with the messageID (mid), then presenting it to the corresponding customer

All three python scripts have two logging handles, one to the console and another one to the Kafka topic `chatbot-logs`. The Web Application will consume all messages in that topic so it can be rendered when accessing http://localhost:8888/logs.

#### Changing the Policies Vector DB on the fly
To make any change on any on the tables, you can do so using your RDBMS of choice and make the changes. The demo is loaded with PgAdmin (http://localhst:5050. Username = `admin@admin.org` | Password = `admin`).

A [Postgres CDC source connector](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-cdc-source-v2-debezium/cc-postgresql-cdc-source-v2-debezium.html) will make sure to capture any change (insert, update, delete) and have them published to Confluent Platform.

To see the changes in action, login to the Chatbot with a different user, or log out and log back in.

You can also have the log web interface open (http://localhost:8888/logs) and be able to see the changes as they happen, for example, after making a change on the table `public.extras` on `id` = `payment`:
```
[webapp] 2024-08-31 11:31:24,971.971 [INFO]
Loaded extras for payment: Accepts most major cards and mobile payments, cash or checks
[chatbot] 2024-08-31 11:31:25,011.011 [INFO]

```
